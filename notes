The Literary Digest polled about 10 million
Americans, and got responses from about
2.4 million.
The poll showed that Landon would likely
be the overwhelming winner and FDR
would get only 43% of the votes.
Election result: FDR won, with 62% of the
votes.

The magazine had surveyed
its own readers,
registered automobile owners, and
registered telephone users.
These groups had incomes well above the national average of
the day (remember, this is Great Depression era) which resulted
in lists of voters far more likely to support Republicans than a
truly typical voter of the time, i.e. the sample was not
representative of the American population at the time.

The Literary Digest election poll was based on a sample size of
2.4 million, which is huge, but since the sample was biased, the
sample did not yield an accurate prediction.
Back to the soup analogy: If the soup is not well stirred, it doesnâ€™t
matter how large a spoon you have, it will still not taste right. If
the soup is well stirred, a small spoon will suffice to test the soup.
