## Sampling from Ames, Iowa

### Plotting 95% intervals
```{r message=FALSE}
load("../Lab4b/more/ames.RData")
population <- ames$Gr.Liv.Area
samp_mean <- rep(NA, 50)
samp_sd <- rep(NA, 50)
n <- 100
for(i in 1:50){
  samp <- sample(population, n) 
  samp_mean[i] <- mean(samp)    
  samp_sd[i] <- sd(samp)        
}
lower_vector <- samp_mean - 1.96 * samp_sd / sqrt(n) 
upper_vector <- samp_mean + 1.96 * samp_sd / sqrt(n)
plot_ci(lower_vector, upper_vector, mean(population))
```

96 out of 100 intervals include the true mean. The proportion is close but not exactly the same to the confidence level. We are 95% certain that the intervals will contain the true mean, which implies 5 out of 100 times they will not. We cannot guarantee what will happen with one particular sample. 

### A different confidence interval: 90%

```{r message=FALSE}
lower_vector <- samp_mean - 1.65 * samp_sd / sqrt(n) 
upper_vector <- samp_mean + 1.65 * samp_sd / sqrt(n)
plot_ci(lower_vector, upper_vector, mean(population))
```

The appropriate critical value, accoridng to the Z table, is 1.65.  

The percentage of intervals that contain the true mean is smaller. As the intervals narrow, we can be less certain.
